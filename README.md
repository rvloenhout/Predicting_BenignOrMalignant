# Predicting_BenignOrMalignant
First project involving Machine Learning. The model aims to predict if a (breast) cancer cell is benign or malignant.

To do:
* Create visualization in Power Bi for EDA
* Do more advanced data transformations
* Create a pipeline for standardization
* Implement the XGBoost algorithm
* Implement a logistic regression algorithm
* Implement a better under/over-sampeling method (Random, SMOTE etc)
* Add more extensive conclusion in readme with process discription
